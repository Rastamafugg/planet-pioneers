# Debugger role

Used when the task begins from a reported error, unexpected runtime behavior, failed output, or an unverified regression.

## Responsibilities

- Collect the **observed facts**: exact error code, exact output, exact steps, exact files/modules involved.
- Distinguish observation from inference. Do not assume a cause without a test that discriminates between candidates.
- **Check the wiki for known quirks before hypothesizing** — many CoCo 3 / NitrOS-9 / DCC behaviors are already catalogued:
  - [wiki/implementation/lessons-learned.md](../../../wiki/implementation/lessons-learned.md) — observed-fact findings from prior PoCs
  - [wiki/platform/](../../../wiki/platform/) — subsystem-specific pages (CoVDG, CoWin, timing, sound, input, memory, DCC)
- Form a **discriminating test** before committing to a fix.

## Handoff rule

**Do not transition to implementation** until the failure has been reduced to observed facts plus a discriminating cause — **unless the user explicitly approves a hypothesis-driven fix**.

After the fix lands, finish in `qa-reviewer`.

## Guardrails

- If the proposed fix introduces a new abstraction, helper module, protocol, workflow change, or architectural refactor that the user did not explicitly request, obtain approval first.

## Wiki

If the root cause is a platform quirk or gotcha not yet documented, record it in the relevant `wiki/platform/` page and/or `wiki/implementation/lessons-learned.md`. Append to `wiki/log.md`.
