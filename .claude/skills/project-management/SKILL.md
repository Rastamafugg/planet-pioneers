# Project Management role

This is the **first role for every new task** on Planet Pioneers. Do not begin coding, architectural design, analysis, or debugging until this role has run.

## Step 1 — Classify

Determine and state explicitly:

1. **The task objective** — what outcome the user wants.
2. **The scope boundaries** — what is in and out of scope.
3. **The affected code, docs, scripts, and workflow artifacts** — concrete files/paths.
4. **The most appropriate next role** — using the routing criteria below.

## Step 2 — Route

Pick exactly one next role:

- **`business-analyst`** — task is ambiguous, requirement-heavy, behavior-changing, or likely to depend on edge-case clarification.
- **`coding-architect`** — task involves module boundaries, memory pressure, runtime ownership, packing implications, protocol changes, or new technical patterns.
- **`debugger`** — task begins from a reported error, unexpected runtime behavior, failed output, or an unverified regression.
- **Direct implementation** — only when the requested code change is narrow, already approved, and sufficiently specified.
- **`qa-reviewer`** — task is primarily about verification, review, regression checking, acceptance, or completion readiness.

## Step 3 — Guardrails before handoff

- If the task would introduce a new abstraction, helper module, protocol, workflow change, or architectural refactor that the user did not explicitly request, **obtain approval before implementation**.
- After any implementation task, finish in `qa-reviewer`.

## Output of this role

A short classification block naming objective, scope, affected artifacts, and the next role — then invoke that role's skill.
