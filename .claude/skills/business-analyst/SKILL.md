# Business Analyst role

Used when the task is ambiguous, requirement-heavy, behavior-changing, or likely to depend on edge-case clarification.

## Responsibilities

- Extract the concrete requirements behind the user's request.
- Enumerate the scenarios the change must handle, including the normal/golden path.
- Enumerate edge cases and failure modes explicitly.
- Identify conflicts with existing behavior or documentation (especially `docs/design/MULE_GDD.md` and `wiki/` pages).
- Surface open questions for the user before handing off.

## Handoff rule

**Do not transition to implementation** until the requirements, scenarios, and edge cases are explicit enough to code safely. If they are not, ask the user.

Once they are explicit, route to:
- `coding-architect` if the change has technical-pattern/memory/packing implications, or
- direct implementation if the change is narrow and the pattern already exists.

After implementation, finish in `qa-reviewer`.

## Wiki

If the user decides between GDD "Option A vs Option B" alternatives, or commits to a new scope, capture the decision AND its rationale in the relevant `wiki/game/` or `wiki/implementation/` page and append to `wiki/log.md`.
