# Memory Layout

## Process model

NitrOS-9 EOU Level 2 gives each process a **single 64 KB logical address space**, mapped from 512 KB physical RAM via an 8 KB-page MMU. Code + data + stack must fit within this 64 KB window (though the **GrfDrv**-managed graphics memory lives in the system map and does not count against process space).

## DCC layout

- **Code segment** — program code
- **Data segment (Y-relative)** — DCC places globals and statics here
- **Stack** — sized via `-m=` flag (e.g. `-m=4k`, `-m=8k`, `-m=32k`)
- **Direct page** — 255 bytes; access by `direct` storage class

## Direct page discipline

255 bytes total. Reserve for hot-path state. Per GDD §23.3:

- `GameState g_state` (~12 bytes) — mode, round, turn order, active player, auction commodity, crystite price
- Hot-path variables — whatever's in tight rendering/animation loops

```c
direct GameState g_state;   /* in direct page */
```

## Memory budget (estimates from GDD §23.3)

| Item | Estimate |
|------|----------|
| Map data (5×9 `Plot` struct) | ~360 B |
| Player data (4 × `Player`) | 64 B |
| Code | 20–30 KB (projected) |
| Stack | ≥2 KB |
| Graphics buffers | System-map (GrfDrv) — out-of-process |
| Runtime overhead (stdio, libc) | — |

Target: program + data < 64 KB.

## Static const data

Place terrain map, tile graphics, and other ROM-safe constants as `static const` so they land in the **code segment** rather than consuming data space:

```c
static const unsigned char terrain_map[MAP_ROWS][MAP_COLS] = { ... };
```

## GrfDrv and screen memory

Video screens allocated via [CoVDG](covdg.md) `SS.AScrn` or [CoWin](cowin.md) come from a **separate pool managed by GrfDrv** in the system memory map, not from process address space.

**Observed limit:** allocating two 32K type-4 CoVDG screens fails (err #207). Two 16K type-2 CoVDG screens work — this is what enables [poc_cvdg16](../sources/poc-sources.md)'s page-flipping.

To access screen bytes directly from the process:
1. `SS.ScInf` — get screen info
2. `F$MapBlk` — map 8 KB blocks of screen RAM into process space
3. Write / block-copy, then unmap or continue using mapped block

[poc_cwext.c](../sources/poc-sources.md) uses this pattern with a 32K back buffer copied 8K at a time.

## Cross-process shared memory

For the multi-process architecture (logic + render + sound), **`F$AllRAM` block IDs are bearer-style** — confirmed against the kernel assembly (`level2/modules/kernel/fallram.asm`):

- `F$AllRAM(B=count)` — allocates `count` contiguous physical 8 KB blocks, returns starting block number in D. Just marks them "used" in the global `D.BlkMap`; no per-process owner is recorded.
- `F$MapBlk(X=block_num, B=count)` — maps blocks into the *caller's* address space, no ownership check.
- Any process that knows the block number can map the same physical bytes.
- **Caveat:** blocks are not auto-freed on process exit. The allocator (or a reclaim path) must call `F$ClrBlk` or they leak until reboot.

For named, refcount-managed sharing, `F$VModul` registers a runtime-built module so children find it via `F$Link`. See [ipc.md](ipc.md) for the full discussion and recommended baseline.
